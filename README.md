The electricity in my area, Dhapakhel,Lalitpur is in making process. so they cut off the electricity for the whole day today since morning.
And I wasnot able to complete my full assignment due to this problem. I feeded my progress to git using data from my mobile.
If I had more time and without electricity problem, I could have made my assignment more fruitful. So please consider my problem,
or give me more time to complete my work.
